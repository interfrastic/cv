World leader in safe, secure, and reliable software embedded in billions of products, from Boeing jetliners to NASA Mars rovers.

### Member of Technical Staff, Engineering Services, 2011 - present

Instrumental in creation of innovative electronic software delivery (ESD) platform providing modern DevOps pipeline for completely re-engineered versions of Wind River's two most important products, VxWorks and Wind River Linux; supplied "big data" business intelligence to multiple internal customers, including analysis pertaining to millions of dollars in revenue recognition.

* Worked on every phase of two business-critical Web applications for ESD, Wind Share (personalized bidirectional content sharing for external customers) and Delivery+ (product definition and delivery portal for internal users), implemented on Play Java framework and ownCloud platform in Java, Scala, JavaScript, and PHP, running in local vSphere and AWS VPC.
* Designed scalable Wind Share offline-installable content delivery system based on Docker container deployment of Play and Spark Java Web framework Java code using AWS Elastic Beanstalk, ECS, and Simple Queue Service, with automatic monitoring of AWS usage for cost control.
* Added DevOps pipeline for cloud-based products to Wind Share through Delivery+ extensions in Java, Scala, and JavaScript.
* Drove smarter business decisions with dashboards and reports created in Splunk, as extended with live data collection, correlation of server logs, database integration, and custom Python scripts and queries.
* Provided product download metrics essential for compliance with new revenue recognition standards by leveraging extensions to Splunk deployment.
* Reduced support call volume with Splunk alerts enabling early repair of content delivery problems.
* Promoted innovation and knowledge sharing by organizing two long-running series of technical talks, expanding audience to include multiple departments and functions.
* Embraced team transformation from support to solutions, along with company-wide transition from Waterfall to Agile, through training in and employment of Scrum, guided by Lean and DevOps philosophies.
* Made entire Wind River product portfolio available in ESD download center (precursor to Wind Share) by collecting, organizing, uploading, recording, and verifying product data and metadata.
* Introduced new project-based Wind River Linux business model and supported more frequent releases by restructuring product and revamping DevOps pipeline.
* Made other DevOps tools (in Python, Scala, Perl, etc.) and infrastructure available for internal engineering uses, including quality improvement through automated validation of commercial product structure.
* Performed significant DevOps work for major product releases and projects, including HTTP microservice in Java to support new Git-based delivery mechanism for Wind River Linux 9.
* Established, documented, and promoted DevOps policies and plans.

### Member of Technical Staff, Release Engineering/Engineering Tools, 2005 - 2011

Supported Wind River's strategic pivot toward Linux and open-source tools through extensive release engineering work; boosted engineering productivity through development and support of product definition, manufacturing, CM, and bug tracking tools.

* Fulfilled rapidly changing business needs of Wind River Linux through commercial product restructuring and data-driven automation of manufacturing process using Perl and Make.
* Managed design, Perl implementation, testing, maintenance, and support of ClearQuest bug tracker integration with ClearCase, CVS, and Git CM systems; all systems stable and reliable throughout six-year lifespan.
* Lead ClearQuest bug tracker e-mail interface project; Perl implementation stable and reliable throughout seven-year lifespan.
* Streamlined delivery pipelines for VxWorks market-specific platforms and Wind River Linux to support more frequent and reliable lightweight releases.
* Continued types of release engineering work undertaken as Senior Software Development Engineer.

### Senior Software Development Engineer, Release Engineering, 2003 - 2005

Enabled a fundamental shift in Wind River's business model through release engineering support of new market-specific platforms and an extensive update of the company's flagship, the VxWorks RTOS.
